# BETA:
## This has only been tested with Xfce (Xubuntu), Unity (Ubuntu), GNOME, and KDE
- Cinnamon and other Mint distros are also in the lineup, but aren't finished yet.
- This has some querks, maybe, largely from Ubuntu and theming irregularities. (Some themes act funny, this auto-sets the least-buggy themes.)
- Read the README.md before reporting problems! !! Seriously.
- Files in boss/ and surf/ have their own purpose and instructions at the top of the files. READ THEM!
- HAVE FUN! !! Seriously.

# Vrk
inkVerb's Vrk app is a collection of simple scripts that sets up a useful configuration for main Ubuntu distros

## How to Install
- Breeze through this READ.ME first!!
- Put "vrk" in your home folder
- Open the terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T)
cd /vrk/inst
chmod +x setupvrk
sudo ./setupvrk
- Answer the two simple folder questions carefully
- Done! :-)

## Different installs
- setupvrk sets up Vrk for the machine (computer): folder and cloud structure, templates, and the ability for other Vrk tools to work
- install-vubuntu-vrkstation installs config files and structure for a specific user (automatically initiated by setupvrk, but only for that user)
- install-vubuntu installs apps and Vubuntu desktop settings & wallpapers

##Ubuntu distros, "Vubuntu Desktop" and Vrk goals
- Vrk adds a special folder configuration: Documents becomes a folder synced in your choice cloud, along with the new "Work" folder.
- ...a simple collection of Templates most may find useful, which syncs to your choice cloud, except in Xfce.
- ...several small "Surfers" (bash scripts) that help connect your computer to a VPS via SSH, and works particularly well with a Verberâ„¢ server.
- Vubuntu Desktop is a kind of "should-be out-of-the-box" configuration for Ubuntu intermediate power-users. The purpose is to bring some continuity for common desktop settings across platforms, setting them up quickly and somewhat standardized so that people can get to work rather than spend hours configuring all the same settings at every fresh Ubuntu install, without interfering with settings or functions that users enjoy in different desktop environments. Eg. Kate is the default editor in KDE, Gedit in all others, but this can be changed either way with set-kate-edit and set-gedit-edit.
- Target distros include: Ubuntu (Unity), GNOME, MATE, and Xubuntu (Xfce); Kubuntu (KDE) and Mint (incl Cinnamon, MATE, KDE, Xfce) are tested for compatability, but second priotiry since Kubuntu lacks command line control and stability. Lubuntu and Edubuntu aren't tested.
- Ubuntu Studio is intended for compatability, but not tested since install .iso images sometimes have trouble. That said, Ubuntu Studio integration is top priority. Wherever Vrk's roadmap finds a conflict with a distro and the ubuntustudio repo packages, Vrk adopts scripts to "trump" settings structures and "Make Ubuntu Studio Work Again."
- Arch and Red Hat (Fedora/CentOS) are not goals because they lack Debian, Arch is already labor intensive by definition and purpose and thus contrary to scope, and Red Hat already has their own thing going.
- Vrk works as close to Ubuntu and Debian cores as possible. The main difference is a GNOME/MATE/Xfce/Unity/KDE check for settings, such as dconf, gsettings, and xquery... or sed and cp for KDE.
- The purpose of Vrk was, initially, to bring a lite version of Ubuntu Studio to your choice of Ubuntu distro. Then it grew.

## Folder configuration (awesomeness, read fully)
- Vrk makes used of Documents, the folder no one uses, by making it a synced folder accessible outside your cloud folder.
- Vrk creates a new "Work" folder for that misc. stuff we use all the time, but don't know where to put. You give it your own name, in this documentation it is called "Work".
- Vrk asks for your primary cloud folder name in which to sync Documents, Templates, and your Work folder; it can be anything.
- These three synced folders move to your cloud and link back to your home folder.
- Vrk installs a set of templates the first time, but won't if it detects a existing Templates folder in your cloud on future installs. Install original Vrk templates anytime via install-vrktemplates.
- Media and Public folders don't move to your cloud because those are usually intended to be local and manged by the user
- Vrk has back-end "machine names" such as INK_DESKTOP_DIR to match XDG_DESKTOP_DIR, via ~/.vrk/configs/lang/stationuser-dirs_CURRENT
- Vrk vrk adds two machine names INK_WORK_DIR (Work folder) and INK_CLOUD_DIR (primary cloud folder) via ~/.vrk/configs/stationinfo
- Vrk changes all folders from whatever language into English, for programming ease.
- If the user's initially installed folders are non-English, Vrk creates ~/MyLang/ and with links to all home folders in the original language, for user reference. English folder names are easier for coding.

## Names
- Vrk's various scripts that do different jobs are called "Surfers". Surfers that require sudo are called "Bosses", but aren't available to non-sudoers.
- A machine with Vrk installed is called a "Vrk Station"
- In other areas of the inkVerb universe, you will see Knights, Serfs, Yoemen, Donjons, and even Dragons. Vrk Stations are for "Surfing" the cloud kingdom and are more relaxed. Verber and Inker from inkVerb are a little more serious as they manage castles in the cloud.

## Integration
- A Vrk Station is intended to do whatever work on your computer, but also effectively control cloud servers.
- Vrk has Surfers to create and add SSH credentials and keys to guake-indicator, FileZilla, a remote server, and Vrk's "gosurf" ssh script, fully via back-end command line.
  - Use: craft-sshkey, add-sshall
  - Surfers are copied to ~/.vrk/boards/
  - Bosses are linked to ~/.vrk/boards/ (only for sudoers) and so they appear as a different color when using "ls" in the terminal.
- A Vrk Station can control many clouds quickly and easily, but also has integration with OpenSource "Verber" servers, see the inkVerb GitHub project and http://verb.ink

## Back-end
- When you install, the vrk "core" folder will move to /var/local/, then creates a .vrk folder in your home withconfigs and links to the core.
- You will need to copy vrk to the home folder each time you want to install it for a user. It's somewhat a one-user-machine app, but can work for others.
- To update Vrk, run the updatevrk Surfer.

## Vubuntu
- Surfers can install different apps quickly and easily, such as install-vubuntu, a lite Ubuntu Studio with common extras, including editors, browsers, dekstop tools.
- installvubuntu runs apt-get install scripts in batches, just in case Internet is unstable. If you get cut-off, you should be able to start over and pick up close to where you lost Internet.
- If you want a full Ubuntu Studio install from the command line, using installvubuntu first will get those EULA and other interactive questions done first and make the rest of ubuntu-studio a lot faster.
- Included with installvubuntu is Docky with a rollup of several common apps and a transparent dock configuration, some normal settings for Guake, and the like.
- Vubuntu is a long-term plan as a possible distro, but aims to work as a seamless add-on for the main Ubuntu distro desktops. If ever a distro, it owuld aim for easy desktop environment changes.
- Note, installvubuntu includes Chris' Dynamic Compressor plugin for Audacity. We remember.
